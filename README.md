# OPD-Folium-Map-Crime-Data-2010-2020


Folium map made inside the Pycharm enviornment. Not hosted anywhere, only can be seen on my local enviornment. Screen shots provided. 
The map shows clusters in order to reduce clutter of crime reports, clicking on a cluster will zoom into cluster and eventually show indivudal markers. Clicking on the markers will give you the category of the crime.
